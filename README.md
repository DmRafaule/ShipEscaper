	This project was written during 18 days. And it was "try"  using some particle effects, written
by my own. And during this developing I was found some issue with cocos2dx engine. Nothing critical but still ...
	So it look better then the last one. I will continue developing games.

It's game available for GNU/Linux, Android, and Windows.(Do not tested on MacOS and Apple, But it have to run on this platforms)
